# Number System Converter

This is a simple C++ program that performs conversions between different number systems, including Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal. The program allows the user to convert numbers between these systems using a simple menu interface.

## Features

- **Decimal to Binary**
- **Binary to Decimal**
- **Decimal to Hexadecimal**
- **Hexadecimal to Decimal**
- **Binary to Hexadecimal**
- **Hexadecimal to Binary**

The program takes input from the user and provides the result in the selected number system.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., **G++** or **Clang**).
- Basic knowledge of number system conversions (Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal).


 **Build the Program**:
   Use a C++ compiler to build the program. For example, with **G++**, run:

## How It Works

Once the program is running, you will see a menu with the following options:

```
Your choices :-
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Decimal to Hexadecimal
4. Hexadecimal to Decimal
5. Binary to Hexadecimal
6. Hexadecimal to Binary
```

You can select a choice by entering the corresponding number. After that, you will be prompted to enter the number you want to convert. The program will display the result of the conversion.

### Example Usage

1. **Decimal to Binary**:
   - Input: `10`
   - Output: `1010` (Binary)

2. **Binary to Decimal**:
   - Input: `1010`
   - Output: `10` (Decimal)

3. **Decimal to Hexadecimal**:
   - Input: `255`
   - Output: `ff` (Hexadecimal)

4. **Hexadecimal to Decimal**:
   - Input: `ff`
   - Output: `255` (Decimal)

5. **Binary to Hexadecimal**:
   - Input: `1010`
   - Output: `a` (Hexadecimal)

6. **Hexadecimal to Binary**:
   - Input: `a`
   - Output: `1010` (Binary)

### Example of Conversion Flow:
```
Your choices :- 
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Decimal to Hexadecimal
4. Hexadecimal to Decimal
5. Binary to Hexadecimal
6. Hexadecimal to Binary
Enter your choice: 1
Enter your desired number: 10
Answer in binary system is: 1010
Do you want to continue? (Yes/No): No
```
